# ✅ **Data Collection Display Issue - FIXED**

## **🎯 Problem Identified**

The data collection page was not showing the actual data collections. The page was mostly empty except for the "ALL" collection card, but the main data table that should display the list of collected stocks was missing.

### **🔍 Root Cause**
- The JavaScript was looking for `collectionsContainer` element
- But the HTML had `collectionsList` element
- This mismatch caused the collections not to be displayed

## **✅ Solution Implemented**

### **Fixed Element Reference**
Updated the JavaScript to reference the correct HTML element:

```javascript
// BEFORE (not working)
const container = document.getElementById('collectionsContainer');

// AFTER (fixed)
const container = document.getElementById('collectionsList');
```
