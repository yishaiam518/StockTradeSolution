# ‚úÖ **Portfolio Integration Issue - FIXED**

## **üéØ Problem Identified**

The issue was that the **wrong modal** was being opened when clicking the "AI Ranking" button. Instead of opening the `aiRankingModal` (which we created with portfolio management), the system was opening the `hybridAIRankingModal` (which only showed status information).

### **üîç Root Cause**
- The `hybridAIRankingModal` was being opened instead of the `aiRankingModal`
- The `hybridAIRankingModal` only showed status information about indicators
- The portfolio management section was missing from the modal that was actually being displayed

## **‚úÖ Solution Implemented**

### **1. Added Portfolio Management to Hybrid Modal**
Added the complete portfolio management section to the `hybridAIRankingModal`:

```html
<!-- Portfolio Management Section -->
<div class="row mb-4">
    <div class="col-12">
        <div class="card border-success">
            <div class="card-header bg-success text-white">
                <h6 class="mb-0"><i class="fas fa-briefcase me-2"></i>Portfolio Management</h6>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <!-- User Portfolio and AI Portfolio buttons -->
                <!-- Portfolio Summary with real-time values -->
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### **2. Added Portfolio Summary Loading**
Modified the `showAIRankingModal` function to load portfolio summary data:

```javascript
// Load AI ranking data
this.loadAIRankingData(collectionId);

// Load portfolio summary data
this.loadPortfolioSummary();
```
